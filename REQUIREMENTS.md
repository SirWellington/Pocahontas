# Project Requirements: Praetorian

## 1. Project Overview
**Praetorian** is a high-performance, local-first desktop photo library application. It serves as a privacy-focused alternative to cloud-based services, allowing users to organize, view, and manage large libraries of photos (including RAW files) entirely offline.

## 2. Tech Stack
*   **Core Framework:** Tauri v2 (System WebView).
*   **Backend Language:** Rust.
*   **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
*   **Database:** SQLite via **SQLx** (Compile-time checked, async runtime).
*   **Image Processing:** **libvips-sys** (for high-speed thumbnailing and Smart Previews).
*   **AI/ML:** **ONNX Runtime** with CUDA/Vulkan support (GPU acceleration).
*   **AI Model:** **RetinaFace** (Selected for high accuracy in face detection).
*   **External Bridge:** Python Subprocess (for AI upscaling tools).

## 3. Core Features

### A. The Catalog System
*   **Local Database:** The app uses a user-selectable `.praetorian` SQLite file as the source of truth.
*   **Import:** Ability to scan local directories (e.g., SD cards, external drives) and index photos into the catalog.
*   **Metadata:** Parse and store EXIF data (Camera, Lens, ISO, GPS, Date) to allow for fast filtering.

### B. Tiered Image Pipeline (Performance)
To ensure the UI remains snappy with large libraries, images are processed in three tiers:
1.  **Tiny Thumbnail:** Generated immediately for the grid view.
2.  **Smart Preview:** A high-quality, medium-resolution JPEG (e.g., 2048px) generated in the background. This is used for the single-image view.
3.  **Full Resolution:** Loaded on-demand only when the user zooms in deeply.

### C. Face Recognition
*   **Detection:** Background worker scans the library for faces using the **RetinaFace** model via ONNX.
*   **GPU Acceleration:** Must utilize Nvidia/AMD GPUs if available via CUDA execution providers.
*   **Organization:** Users can group detected faces and assign them names (e.g., "Sarah", "John").
*   **Search:** A search interface to query photos by person.

### D. AI Upscaling (Python Bridge)
*   **Integration:** A Rust-to-Python bridge that spawns a subprocess to run external AI upscaling scripts (e.g., Real-ESRGAN).
*   **Workflow:** User selects image and desired image size -> Rust spawns Python script -> Script processes image -> Rust updates UI with success status.

## 4. UI/UX Guidelines
*   **Style:** "Lightroom Cloud" aesthetic. Clean, dark-mode default, minimal chrome. See a design mockup at [design/mockups/00000-4162059048.png].
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Left:** Sidebar for Folders/Albums.
    *   **Center:** Photo Grid (Virtual Scrolling).
    *   **Right:** Metadata Panel (EXIF details).
*   **Responsiveness:** The main thread must never block. All image processing and AI tasks run in background async workers.

## 5. Development Roadmap
1.  **Stage 1 (Foundation):** Tauri setup, SQLx Schema, Directory Import, LibVips Thumbnailing, Basic Grid UI.
2.  **Stage 2 (Smart Previews):** Implement the background worker for Smart Preview generation.
3.  **Stage 3 (Face AI):** Integrate ONNX Runtime + RetinaFace for background face indexing.
4.  **Stage 4 (Python Bridge):** Implement the subprocess bridge for upscaling.
